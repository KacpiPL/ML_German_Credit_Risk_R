# ML - German Credit Risk

## Project Overview

Welcome to our project "ML - German Credit Risk", where several ML methods are applied to classify bank clients. The procet is part of the "Machine Learning 2" course.

In this project we go throught the whole model development process. Firstly, we  preprocess the data and conduct a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Subsequently, we  employ Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the final features. We then proceed to build models using XGBoost (XGB), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Our approach involves hyperparameter tuning, following the methodology taught in classes. Additionally, we explore building models using the tidymodels package and a general approach.

Finally, we compare these methods to determine the best-performing models.

You can find the pdf presentation in the "presentation" folder and we highly encourage you to see the html report [here](https://rpubs.com/KacpiPL/ML_German_Credit_Risk).

### Data source

We base on the dataset delivered by our lecturer. The dataset contains additional 10 "mysterious" variables (feat01 - feat10) generated by him. While the exact details of how these variables were generated are not provided, they may contain additional features or information that could be relevant for analysis.
